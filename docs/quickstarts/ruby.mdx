Learn how to use Clerk to quickly and easily add secure authentication and user management to your Ruby app.

<Steps>
  ## Install `clerk-sdk-ruby`

  The [Clerk Ruby SDK](/docs/references/ruby/overview) provides a range of backend utilities to simplify user authentication and management in your application.

  1. Add the following code to your application's `Gemfile`.
     ```ruby {{ filename: 'TODO' }}
     gem 'clerk-sdk-ruby', require: "clerk"
     ```
  1. Run the following command to install the SDK:
     ```sh {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
     $ bundle install
     ```

  {/* TODO: Does this do the same as above? */}

  Or install it yourself as:

  ```sh {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
  $ gem install clerk-sdk-ruby
  ```

  ## Set your Clerk API keys

  <SignedIn>
    Add the following keys to your `.env` file. These keys can always be retrieved from the [**API keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page in the Clerk Dashboard.
  </SignedIn>

  <SignedOut>
    1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**API keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page.
    1. In the **Quick Copy** section, copy your Secret Key.
    1. Paste your key into your `.env` file.

    The final result should resemble the following:
  </SignedOut>

  ```env {{ filename: '.env' }}
  CLERK_SECRET_KEY={{secret}}
  ```

  ## Configuration

  The Clerk Ruby SDK supports the following configuration methods, listed in order of precedence (highest to lowest):

  - [Configuration object](#configuration-object)
  - [Environment variables](#environment-variables)

  ### Configuration object

  The configuration object provides a flexible way to configure the SDK. When a configuration value is not explicitly provided, it will fall back to checking the corresponding environment variable. The following example shows all supported configuration options:

  {/* TODO: Does it show all supported options?? Is that a true statement? */}

  ```ruby
  Clerk.configure do |c|
    c.secret_key = `{{secret}}` # if omitted: ENV["CLERK_SECRET_KEY"] - API calls will fail if unset
    c.base_url = "https://..." # if omitted: "https://api.clerk.com/v1/"
    c.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT) # if omitted, no logging
    c.middleware_cache_store = Rails.cache # if omitted: no caching
  end
  ```

  For more information, see [Faraday's documentation](https://lostisland.github.io/faraday/#/).

  ### Environment variables

  The Ruby SDK supports the following environment variables:

  | Variable name | Usage |
  | - | - |
  | `CLERK_API_BASE` | Overrides the default API base URL: `https://api.clerk.com/v1/` |
  | `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` | The Secret Key of your instance (required) |
  | `CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL` | Rails view helper: `clerk_sign_in_url` |
  | `CLERK_SIGN_IN_UP` | Rails view helper: `clerk_sign_up_url` |
  | `CLERK_USER_PROFILE_URL` | Rails view helper: `clerk_user_profile_url` |

  ## Instantiate a `Clerk::SDK` instance

  To access all [Backend API endpoints](/docs/reference/backend-api){{ target: '_blank' }}, you must instantiate a `Clerk::SDK` instance.

  The following example demonstrates how to instantiate an instance of `Clerk::SDK` and then send your first user a welcome email.

  ```ruby
  sdk = Clerk::SDK.new

  create_user_request = Clerk::SDK::CreateUserRequest.new(
    first_name: "John",
    last_name: "Doe",
    email_address: ["john.doe@example.com"],
    password: "password"
  )

  sdk.users.create(create_user_request)

  # List all users
  sdk.users.all

  # Get your first user
  user = sdk.users.all(limit: 1).first

  # Lock the user
  sdk.users.lock(user["id"])

  # Unlock the user
  sdk.users.unlock(user["id"])
  ```
</Steps>
