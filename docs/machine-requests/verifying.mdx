## Verifying Tokens

For every valid Clerk [machine request](/docs/machine-requests/overview), a [machine token](/docs/machine-requests/machine-tokens) will be present in the Bearer `Authorization` header. You must validate this token isn't expired and is authentic (i.e., no malicious user tried to tamper with it), which indicates that the machine is authenticated to your application.

The `authenticateRequest()` method from the JavaScript Backend SDK handles these validations for you. It accepts the `request` object and authenticates the machine token in it. See the [reference page](/docs/references/backend/authenticate-request) for more information.

### Machine Tokens

Machine tokens authenticate machines. They are typically provided via the Authorization header in your backend requests.

If the token is valid, it means that the machine is authenticated to your application.

To authenticate machine requests using `authenticateRequest()`, specify the `entity` parameter as `'machine'`. See the [reference page](/docs/references/backend/authenticate-request) for more information.

The following example uses the `authenticateRequest()` method with the [JavaScript Backend SDK](/docs/references/backend/overview) to verify that the token is a valid machine token generated by Clerk.

```tsx
import { createClerkClient } from '@clerk/backend'

export async function GET(req: Request) {
  const clerkClient = createClerkClient({
    secretKey: process.env.CLERK_SECRET_KEY,
    publishableKey: process.env.CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY,
  })

  const { isMachineAuthenticated, machinedId } = await clerkClient.authenticateRequest(req, {
    entity: 'machine',
  })

  if (!authReq.isMachineAuthenticated) {
    return Response.json({ status: 401 })
  }

  return Response.json({
    message: 'Machine is authenticated',
    machineId,
  })
}
```
