## Introduction

Machine-to-machine (M2M) authentication allows services, scripts, or devices (machines) to securely communicate with each other without the need for a user's session.

## Why Use Machine-to-Machine Authentication?

- **Automated Processes**: Services like cron jobs, background workers, or CI/CD pipelines often need to interact with APIs securely without user intervention.
- **Inter-Service Communication**: Microservices architectures require secure communication between different services within your infrastructure.
- **Device Authentication**: IoT devices or embedded systems may need to authenticate with backend services to send or receive data.

## How Machine Tokens Work in Clerk

In the context of Clerk, machine-to-machine authentication is facilitated through [machine tokens](/docs/machine-requests/machine-tokens), which are JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) specifically designed to represent the identity of a machine. These tokens allow you to [create machine requests](/docs/machine-requests/making) from one service, and [verify incoming machine requests](/docs/machine-requests/verifying) in another service.
