> [!WARNING]
> **This feature is not designed for handling authentication directly in your application.** To handle authentication _in your_ application, you can [configure one of the many social providers that Clerk offers](/docs/authentication/social-connections/oauth#configuration), such as Google.

Clerk can be configured as an OAuth 2.0 provider to facilitate Single Sign-On (SSO) with other Clients that support the OAuth 2.0 protocol. This feature allows users to authenticate to other applications using their Clerk credentials, enabling user information sharing between your Clerk application and OAuth Clients.

## When should you use Clerk as an OAuth 2.0 provider?

You can use Clerk as an OAuth 2.0 provider if you want your users to authenticate to a third party site or a tool using their credentials from your application. **This is not the same as supporting an OAuth provider, such as Google, in your application. If you want your users to be able to sign in to your application with an OAuth provider, see the [dedicated guide](/docs/authentication/social-connections/oauth#configuration).**

## How it works

In order to make your Clerk instance operate as an OAuth 2.0 provider, you just need to create an OAuth application. Then, you will need to configure the external service to work with your Clerk instance, using the necessary data from your OAuth application.

### Create an OAuth application in Clerk

In order to create an OAuth application, in the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**OAuth Applications**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/oauth-applications) page.

You will have to provide a `Name` which helps you to identify your application, a `Callback URL` which you will need to retrieve from the OAuth Client and lastly to select the `Scopes` that would like to leverage.

Optionally, you can also enable the `Public` mode, which means that you will be able to use the OAuth 2.0 PKCE flow.

> [!WARNING]
> For security reasons, Clerk does not store your Client Secret and cannot show it to you again, so we recommend you download the secret and store it someplace secure.

Now that you have set up an OAuth application in Clerk, you will need to configure these settings in your OAuth Client.

- **Client ID**: Public identifier of your OAuth application
- **Client Secret**: Confidential secret used to authenticate your OAuth application
- **Authorize URL**: Used by the Client to request authorization from your user
- **Token URL**: Used by the Client to exchange an Authorization Code for an Access Token and a Refresh Token
- **User Info URL**: Used by the Client to retrieve additional user data upon authentication
- **Discovery URL**: Used by the Client to retrieve the configuration data of the OAuth 2.0 provider

### OAuth 2.0 Scopes

Scopes let you specify exactly which user data to make available and what type of access you need. Currently, the following are supported:

| Scope | Access |
| - | - |
| profile | Grant access to the user personal information, such as first and last name, avatar and username |
| email | Grant access to the user email address |
| public\_metadata | Grant access to the user public and unsafe metadata |
| private\_metadata | Grant access to the user private metadata |

### User Info

After a user has successfully completed an OAuth 2.0 flow, you can use the obtained Access Token, in the Authorization header, to retrieve additional user information from the User Info endpoint (`/oauth/userinfo`) based on the granted scopes.

The User Info endpoint makes available the following user properties:

| Property | Description |
| - | - |
| user\_id | The ID of the user |
| given\_name | The first name of the user |
| family\_name | The last name of the user |
| name | The full name of the user |
| picture | The avatar URL of the user |
| preferred\_username | The username of the user |
| email | The primary email address of the user |
| email\_verified | Whether the primary email address of the user is verified |
| public\_metadata | The public metadata of the user |
| private\_metadata | The private metadata of the user |
| unsafe\_metadata | The unsafe metadata of the user |

### Token Introspection Endpoint

If you are looking to get additional information or validate an Access Token or a Refresh Token, you can use the [Token Introspection Endpoint](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/token-introspection-endpoint/) (`/oauth/token_info`)

The Clerk provider will return the token information, such as if it's still active and the granted scopes.

Please notice that this endpoint is protected and you will need to provide your Client ID and Client Secret in order to authenticate.

### OAuth 2.0 grant types

Clerk OAuth 2.0 provider supports the following flows and grant types:

- [Authorization Code](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/authorization-code/)
- [PKCE](https://oauth.net/2/pkce/)
- [Refresh token](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/refresh-token/)

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

### When do the tokens expire?

Access Tokens expire after 2 hours, Refresh Tokens expire after 3 days and Authorization Codes expire after 10 minutes.

### Is OpenID Connect supported?

At this time, OIDC is not supported.
