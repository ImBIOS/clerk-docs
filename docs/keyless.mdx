title: Keyless Mode
description: Develop locally without requiring a Clerk account.
---

**Keyless Mode** allows you to try out Clerk in your local development environment without having to sign up for a Clerk account.

> [!WARNING]
> Keyless mode is only available in Next.js projects when developing locally. If you attempt to build your project for production, Clerk will throw an error.

## How does it work?

If Clerk's SDK doesn't detect valid [Clerk keys](TODO) in your environment, it will automatically fetch a set of keys for you. These keys are associated with a Clerk development instance that has a default configuration. When running locally in Keyless Mode, you'll see a UI toast indicating that you're running in this special mode with a link to claim your instance by signing up for a Clerk account, or signing in if you already have one.

Keys are written to a file in a `.clerk` directory in your project. The Clerk SDK will try to add this directory to your `.gitignore` file to prevent keys from being committed to your repository.

### Default configuration

Clerk development instances have the following default configuration:

- **Authentication**: Email and password, Sign-in with Google, Sign-in with GitHub
- **Verification**: Email verification is required
- **Password reset**: Password reset is enabled
- **MFA**: MFA is disabled
- **Appearance**: Default appearance

When using Clerk in Keyless Mode, you're not able to make configuration changes to your instance. To make changes, [claim your instance](#claiming-keys).

## Keyless Mode support

Keyless mode works with Clerk's SDKs for [Next.js](/docs/quickstarts/nextjs). If you're using a different framework or SDK, you'll need to manually configure Clerk keys in your environment. Visit the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/sign-up) to create an account, create an instance, and get your keys.

## Claiming keys

When you're ready to make configuration changes to your instance, you can claim the automatically generated keys. To do this, click the "Claim keys" button in the Clerk toolbar on your local application.

You'll then be prompted to sign up for a Clerk account, or sign in if you already have one. After authenticating, give your application a name and the keys will be associated with your account. You'll need to copy and paste the keys into your `.env` file to persist them in your project. This will disable Keyless Mode. If you don't add keys to your environment, you'll see a warning to let you know the instance has been claimed, but keys haven't been set.
