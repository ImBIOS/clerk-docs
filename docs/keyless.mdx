title: Keyless Mode
description: Learn how to use Keyless Mode to prototype and test Clerk's authentication features locally without creating an account or managing API keys.
---

Keyless Mode allows you to quickly prototype and test Clerk's authentication features in your **local Next.js development environment** without creating a Clerk account.

See [Next.js Keyless Quickstart](/docs/nextjs-keyless) for a step-by-step guide to get started with Keyless Mode.

## How Keyless Mode works

When no [Clerk keys](/docs/deployments/clerk-environment-variables#clerk-publishable-and-secret-keys) are detected, the Clerk SDK automatically:

1. Generates temporary API keys from Clerk
1. Creates an instance with [default configuration](#default-configuration-for-development-instances)
1. Stores keys in a `.clerk` directory which is added to `.gitignore`. Do not commit this folder to your repository. Deleting the `.clerk` folder will cause new temporary keys to generated for a new instance.
1. Shows a **Clerk is in keyless mode** button to manage your instance

## How do I opt-out?

Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_KEYLESS_DISABLED` in your `.env.local` file.

```env {{ filename: '.env.local' }}
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_KEYLESS_DISABLED=1
```

## Default configuration for development instances

Development instances start with these preset configurations:

- **Authentication**: Email and password are required, Google and GitHub sign-in are enabled
- **Verification**: Email verification is required
- **Password reset**: Enabled
- **MFA**: Disabled
- **Appearance**: Default theme

> [!NOTE]
> These settings cannot be modified until you claim your instance.

## Claim your instance and disable Keyless Mode

To customize your instance and disable Keyless Mode:

1. In your application running on localhost, select **Claim keys** in the bottom-right corner. This opens the **Claim Your Application** page.
1. On the **Claim Your Application** page, complete the form by entering your application name and selecting an organization, then select **Claim application**.
1. Copy your new API keys to your `.env.local` file:
   ```env {{ filename: '.env.local' }}
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
   CLERK_SECRET_KEY={{secret}}
   ```
1. Select **Go to application**. You'll be redirected your application's **Overview** page.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After claiming your instance, you must add the keys to your `.env.local` file to fully disable Keyless Mode. Without this step, you'll continue to see warnings that your instance is claimed but not properly configured.

## Limitations

- Works only with **Next.js projects in local development**
- Development instances can't be customized without claiming
- Production builds require proper Clerk keys
