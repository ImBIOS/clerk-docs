description: Learn how to integrate Clerk into your Nuxt application using the Clerk Nuxt SDK.

The Nuxt SDK is built on top of the [Vue SDK](/docs/sdk/vue/methods), and is the recommended method for integrating Clerk into your Nuxt application.

## Client-side helpers

Because the Nuxt SDK is built on top of the Clerk Vue SDK, you can use the composables that the Vue SDK provides. These composables give you access to the [`Clerk`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/clerk) object and a set of useful helper methods for signing in and signing up. Learn more in the [Vue SDK reference](/docs/sdk/vue/methods).

## `Auth` object

The `Auth` object is available at `event.context.auth` in your [event handlers](https://h3.unjs.io/guide/event-handler). This JavaScript object contains important information like session data, your user's ID, as well as their organization ID. [Learn more](/docs/references/backend/types/auth-object).

## `clerkMiddleware()`

The `clerkMiddleware()` helper integrates Clerk authentication and authorization into your Nuxt application through middleware. [Learn more](/docs/sdk/nuxt/clerk-middleware).

## `clerkClient()`

The `clerkClient()` helper returns an instance of the [JavaScript Backend SDK](/docs/references/backend/overview). [Learn more](/docs/sdk/nuxt/read-session-data#clerk-client).
