These are all methods on the [`SignUp`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-up/sign-up) class that allow you to verify a user's sign-up request via email.

## `prepareEmailAddressVerification()`

Initiates an email verification process for the email address associated with the current sign-up attempt. This method sends a verification code or link (depending on the strategy) to the provided email address. The verification method must be [configured in your Clerk Dashboard](/docs/authentication/configuration/sign-up-sign-in-options#verification-methods).

The defaults of this method are equivalent to calling [`SignUp.prepareVerification('email_code')`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-up/verification#prepareverification).

```typescript
function prepareEmailAddressVerification(
  params?: PrepareEmailAddressVerificationParams,
): Promise<SignUpResource>
```

### `PrepareEmailAddressVerificationParams`

<Properties>
  - `strategy`
  - `'email_code' | 'email_link'`

  The strategy used to verify the user's email address during sign-up. Supported values:<br /><ul><li>`email_code`: Sends a one-time verification code via email that the user must input to verify their address</li><li>`email_link`: Sends an email containing a verification link that, when visited, automatically verifies the user's email address</li></ul>

  ---

  - `redirectUrl`
  - `string`

  The URL to redirect the user to after the verification process is complete.<br />Only supported with `email_link`, `oauth_<provider>`, and `saml` strategies.
</Properties>

## `attemptEmailAddressVerification()`

Validates an email verification code during sign-up. **This method is only required when using the `email_code` verification strategy.** It compares the provided verification code against the one-time code sent to the user's email address during the `prepareEmailAddressVerification()` step. If the codes match, the email address is marked as verified.

This is equivalent to calling [`SignUp.attemptVerification({strategy: 'email_code', ...params})`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-up/verification#attempt-verification).

```typescript
function attemptEmailAddressVerification(
  params: AttemptEmailAddressVerificationParams,
): Promise<SignUpResource>
```

### `AttemptEmailAddressVerificationParams`

<Properties>
  - `code`
  - `string`

  The code that was sent to the user via email.
</Properties>
