The `useLocalCredentials()` hook lets you to store a user's password credentials on their device, enabling biometric sign-in for future sessions. This improves the user experience by allowing sign-in with Face ID or other biometric methods.

> [!WARNING]
> This API is available only for [@clerk/clerk-expo](/docs/upgrade-guides/expo-v2/upgrade) v2.2.0 or later. This works only for sign-in attempts with the [password strategy.](/docs/authentication/configuration/sign-up-sign-in-options#authentication-strategies)

## Returns

<Properties>
  - `hasCredentials`
  - `boolean`

  Indicates if there are any credentials stored on the device.

  ---

  - `userOwnsCredentials`

  ---

  - `biometricType`
  - `'face-recognition' | 'fingerprint' | null`

  Indicates the supported enrolled biometric authenticator type.

  ---

  - `setCredentials()`
  - <code>(params: [LocalCredentials](#local-credentials)) => Promise\<void></code>

  Stores the provided credentials on the device if biometrics are enrolled. The end user must have a passcode set for the credentials to be stored, and the credentials will be removed if the passcode is removed. The promise rejects if the value can't be stored on the device.

  ---

  - `clearCredentials()`
  - <code>() => Promise\<void></code>

  Removes the stored credentials from the device. The promise rejects if the value can't be deleted from the device.

  ---

  - `authenticate()`
  - <code>() => Promise\<[SignInResource](/docs/references/javascript/sign-in/sign-in)></code>

  Attempts to read the stored credentials and creates a sign-in attempt with the password strategy.The promise resolves to a `SignInResource` if the stored credentials were accessed. Otherwise, the promise rejects.
</Properties>
