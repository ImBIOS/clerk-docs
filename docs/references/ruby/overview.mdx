description: Learn how to integrate Ruby into your Clerk application.
---

<Steps>
  ## Create a Clerk application

  You need to create a Clerk application in the Clerk Dashboard before you can set up Clerk Ruby. For more information, see the [setup guide](/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk).

  ## Install Ruby

  Once a Clerk application has been created, you can install and then start using Clerk Ruby in your application.

  Add this line to your application's Gemfile.

  ```ruby
  gem 'clerk-sdk-ruby', require: "clerk"
  ```

  And then execute:

  ```sh {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
  $ bundle install
  ```

  Or install it yourself as:

  ```sh {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
  $ gem install clerk-sdk-ruby
  ```

  ## Configuration

  The SDK can be configured in three ways: environment variables, configuration singleton and constructor arguments. The priority goes like this:

  - Configuration object
  - Environment variables

  ### Configuration object

  If an argument is not provided, the configuration object is looked up, which falls back to the associated environment variable. Here's an example with all supported configuration settings their environment variable equivalents:

  ```ruby
  Clerk.configure do |c|
    c.secret_key = `{{secret}}` # if omitted: ENV["CLERK_SECRET_KEY"] - API calls will fail if unset
    c.base_url = "https://..." # if omitted: "https://api.clerk.com/v1/"
    c.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT) # if omitted, no logging
    c.middleware_cache_store = Rails.cache # if omitted: no caching
  end
  ```

  For more information, see [Faraday's documentation](https://lostisland.github.io/faraday/#/).

  ### Environment variables

  Here's a list of all environment variables the SDK uses:

  | Variable name | Usage |
  | - | - |
  | `CLERK_API_BASE` | Overrides the default API base URL: `https://api.clerk.com/v1/` |
  | `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` | The Secret Key of your instance (required) |
  | `CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL` | Rails view helper: `clerk_sign_in_url` |
  | `CLERK_SIGN_IN_UP` | Rails view helper: `clerk_sign_up_url` |
  | `CLERK_USER_PROFILE_URL` | Rails view helper: `clerk_user_profile_url` |

  ## Instantiate a `Clerk::SDK` instance

  To access all [Backend API endpoints](/docs/reference/backend-api){{ target: '_blank' }}, you need to instantiate a `Clerk::SDK` instance.

  You will need your Clerk Secret Key to instantiate an instance. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**API keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page and copy your Secret Key.

  This simple example shows how to instantiate an instance of `Clerk::SDK` with your Secret Key and then send your first user a welcome email.

  ```ruby
  sdk = Clerk::SDK.new

  create_user_requset = Clerk::SDK::CreateUserRequest.new(
    first_name: "John",
    last_name: "Doe",
    email_address: ["john.doe@example.com"],
    password: "password"
  )

  sdk.users.create(create_user_request)

  # List all users
  sdk.users.all

  # Get your first user
  user = sdk.users.all(limit: 1).first

  # Lock the user
  sdk.users.lock(user["id"])

  # Unlock the user
  sdk.users.unlock(user["id"])
  ```
</Steps>

## Available methods

The Ruby HTTP Client is a generated wrapper around the [Backend API](/docs/reference/backend-api){{ target: '_blank' }} that provides a more Ruby-friendly interface.

### Resources

All available methods are listed in the [Ruby HTTP Client repository documentation](https://github.com/clerk/clerk-ruby-http-client/){{ target: '_blank' }}.
